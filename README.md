### All of the trouble we went through was worth it in the end since we are now able to present a completely working program.

<--- INTRODUCTION -->

## About

In our algorithm course, we studied binary trees. In the continuity of our course and to apply the knowledge we have just learned, we have done the Automated Sentence Generator project in C.

The goal of this project is to automatically generate sentences that are grammatically and orthographically correct, but do not necessarily make sense. This program is similar to the game called Cadavre Exquis.

## Run the program

- To run the program, you can write the following command :
  ```sh
  ./Test.exe
  ```
